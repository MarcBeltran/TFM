A great amount of the interesting information captured by aerial imagery is still not being used given how labour intensive the processing and annotation of these images is. Despite this, improvements in technology and advancements in the computer vision field have made available tools and techniques that can help make this process semi-automatized. In this project we focus on the use case of extracting roads from aerial imagery. For this purpose, we will study and compare models based on image segmentation using deep learning and RoadTracer, a revolutionary model proposed recently.

### Objetive

Given the big scope of the proposed project, we reduced it to finding a specific type of features from aerial images. This project is dedicated to the study and implementation of techniques for locating roads in orthophotos. By this we mean to, given an input satelite image, create an output which shows the location of the road in the image.

## Structure

This project is devided into two main blocks, the part of sementic segmentation using models based on deep learning models and the part based on the application of the RoadTracer model.
